PrestashopModuleBuilder
=======================

This branch is abandonned, use [beta-slim](https://github.com/SebSept/PrestashopModuleBuilder/tree/beta-slim) instead.

PrestashopModuleBuilder is a tool to help you code [Prestashop](http://www.prestashop.com/) modules.

## What does it do ?

It just produce a php file with the structure for your module.

It can help you save time in the first step writing a module.

## Demo

[You can test and use it.](http://prestashop.seb7.fr/prestashop-module-builder/)

### About

I wanted to a give a try to [silex php framework](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) so i dedided to test it, writing that simple app. I may have do things wrong...

### Improvements

There is lot to do, I have ideas, maybe you have...

Caution : it will stop using silex and use slim, very soon.
